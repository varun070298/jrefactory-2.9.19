TODO for JavaStyle
------------------

* screen is not updated during reformat (busy cursor is not shown)
* reformat a set of files
* reformat current selection only


The following PrettyPrinter settings currently do not have a gui option
=======================================================================

* sort.#=Final(bottom|top)

  Sort the fields with initializers to the top
     * top - the final methods and fields should be sorted to the top
     * bottom - the final methods and fields should be sorted to the bottom
  Note: as of JRefactory version 2.6.25, this option is unusuable.

* sort.#=Alphabetical()

  Sort the fields, methods, and classes in alphabetical order
  Note: as of JRefactory version 2.6.25, this option is unusuable.

* javadoc.star=2

  Star count for the start of a javadoc comment, e.g. if javadoc.star=4
  we get:
  /****
   * blah
   */

* cast.force.nospace=true|false

  Do we force a space after a cast? I don't know how this differs from the
  option cast.space

* maintain.newlines.around.imports=true|false

  Keep all the newlines around imports. The default (true) is good enough.

* header.*, footer.*

* exception.tag.name=@exception | @throws

* char.stream.type=1

  This feature describes what type of characters are used for the java files.
  1 - ASCII (1 byte characters)
  2 - Unicode (2 byte characters - far east)
  3 - ASCII full (2 byte characters - far east)

* import.sort.neighbourhood=0

  If you want classes that are written by you to move to the end of the list of
  imports change this value.
  0 - Keep all the imports in alphabetical order
  1 - If the package and the import start with the same value - com or org - put them at the end
  2 - When package and import share 2 directory levels, the imports are listed last
  3 - When package and import share 3 directory levels, the imports are listed last
